# Phishing Detection System

## Overview
Phishing Detection System is a machine learning-based project designed to identify and prevent phishing attacks by analyzing URLs, email content, and other relevant features. This tool helps users and organizations detect fraudulent websites or emails aimed at stealing sensitive information.

## Features
- URL analysis for phishing characteristics  
- Email content scanning (optional)  
- Machine learning model trained on phishing and legitimate samples  
- Real-time detection with high accuracy  
- Easy to integrate into existing security systems  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (whichever you used)  
- Pandas, NumPy for data processing  
- Flask / FastAPI (if you made a web API)  
- Other libraries/tools you used

## Dataset
The model was trained on a dataset containing X phishing URLs and Y legitimate URLs sourced from [source].  
Preprocessing steps included cleaning URLs, feature extraction, etc.

## Results
- Accuracy: 95%  
- Precision: 93%  
- Recall: 92%  
- F1-score: 92.5%
