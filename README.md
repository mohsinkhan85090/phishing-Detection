Features
URL analysis for phishing characteristics

Email content scanning (optional)

Machine learning model trained on phishing and legitimate samples

Real-time detection with high accuracy

Easy to integrate into existing security systems

Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (whichever you used)

Pandas, NumPy for data processing

Flask / FastAPI (if you made a web API)

Other libraries/tools you used
